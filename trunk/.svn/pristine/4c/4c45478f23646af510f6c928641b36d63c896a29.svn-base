== Description ==

Melu is a managed live chat service that provides live chat software via this plugin, and highly trained professional operators that look after it for you.

Melu is perfect for businesses that don't have the internal human resources to look after their own live chat, but want the reliability of real people rather than using chatbots.

Melu's operators are always online and ready to engage with your website visitors from 8am to 10pm Monday to Friday (UK time).

Melu is free to try for 30 days, then costs just £99 + VAT per month!

When Melu is active on your website, our operators can see when you have visitors. Only basic information such as current page URL, IP address, browser, OS and screen resolution is available to us. We use this information to see whether a visitor has interacted with our live chat invite.

== Installation ==

Install the Melu plugin directly from the plugins admin section of your WordPress site, or download and install from wordpress.com.

Once the plugin is activated, visit the Melu control panel via the main admin menu on the left and enter your unique Melu code and click 'Apply'. This will activate the Melu live chat widget on all pages of your website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

What is Melu?
Melu provides live chat software for your website, as well as a team of highly trained human chat operators that look after your website visitors for you.

The ultimate goal of Melu is to help convert more of your website visitors into leads. When a visitor has questions or isn't sure about something, they often leave and go elsewhere. Melu gives them the option to use live chat and get the answers they need. If we can't answer, or if they want to speak to someone, we find out what they need and take their details in a friendly and efficient manner. We then pass their details onto you to follow up and turn into a new customer!

How does Melu work?
When you create an account, we set you up on our system and put together a shared FAQs document that you have access to. Our operators use your FAQ document to help answer any questions your visitors have.

When a someone is on your website, we send them an invite to chat - 'Hi, how can I help you today?'. This shows the visitor that live chat is available to them.

If the visitor wishes to chat, they can respond to the invite or start a chat themselves. Normally visitors ask questions about your products and services or tell us directly what they need. The job of our operators is to answer their questions and get their contact details on your behalf.

Depending on your requirements, we can also send visitors to action points on your website, such as sign-up forms and calls to action, simply by offering them a link to follow.

If your visitors ask questions that aren't in your shared FAQs document, we'll add them in and let you know so you can help improve the knowledge base of answers.

On average Melu converts 60% of chats into leads for our clients.

Is Melu free?
We offer a free 30 day trial for all new users, but Melu is a paid for service, so the cost after trial is £99 + VAT per month.

How much does it cost?
Melu costs £99 + VAT per month after your free trial has been completed.

Do I need to have a credit or debit card to sign-up?
No! You can sign-up without commitment at https://meluchat.com/try-melu. Your first 30 days are free. If you wish to continue using Melu, you'll be sent details for setting up a direct debit agreement via GoCardless (UK only). You can also pay on invoice via BACS.

Is there a minimum contract?
No! We offer a rolling monthly contract so you can cancel at any time and use until the current paid month is over.

Does Melu use real human operators?
Yes! This is core to our business model - real people get better results. We never use chat bots or operators that don't have English as their first language.

Where are Melu's operators based?
We have two teams of operators based in the UK and the USA.

Do you invite our visitors to chat?
Yes - we send invites to visitors by default, but you can tell us not to do this if you wish. We send an automatic invite to the visitor after 30 seconds of them landing on your website. If they choose to close the invite, our operators can see that, and therefore no more invites are sent. We will only send an invite to a visitor once, so they're not bombarded with invites every time they move to a different page.

What are your operating hours?
We currently operate between 8am and 10pm (UK time - GMT/BST) Monday to Friday. We're adding weekends soon!

What happens outside of operating hours?
During these times the Melu chat widget goes into message mode, which is basically a contact form so visitors can leave a message. We can change this to instead link directly to your own form on your website if you'd prefer.

What is a lead?
A lead is a chat that requires your follow-up. In most cases this is where the visitor is interested in being contacted about your products and services, so it's important to act fast when it comes through! On some occasions a visitor may use live chat to report an issue with your website, or a typo or something similar. We'll raise this as a lead so you are notified, even though it's not really a lead.

What happens when a chat isn't a lead?
When we handle a chat that doesn't get the visitors details, or it doesn't require you to follow-up, it's sent direct to your client portal. You won't receive an email notification, but you can view the full transcript via your client portal.

Do I get notified when a lead comes through live chat?
Yes - as soon as a lead is raised in our system an email is sent to you with the details of the visitor and the full chat transcript. This data is also logged in your client portal.

Can I track my leads and chat sessions?
Yes! Once your trial has started you'll be sent details to login to our website and access your client portal. Here you'll be able to see all of the chat sessions and transcripts, as well as traffic reports and other analytics. You can also export your chats into a .csv file. Many of our clients find it very useful to review their chat sessions, as it helps them improve the FAQs document and enhance the way we handle their visitors.

Is Melu GDPR compliant?
Yes it is! We take your data protection very seriously. Once a chat is completed by one of our operators and sent to your portal, they no longer have access to any of the data. Only you can see it within your client portal. The portal also gives you the ability to remove data upon request.

If I want to stop using Melu, what do I do?
At the end of your trial we'll send you a report so you can see how things went. If you don't want to continue using Melu, let us know via email (hello@meluchat.com), then deactivate it via the Melu control panel in WordPress. Once deactivated you can then remove the plugin completely if necessary.
